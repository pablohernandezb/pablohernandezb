## Hi there, I'm Pablo! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

Hello! I craft models using AI and ML to understand our world. I am a Computer Engineer from [Universidad Simon Bolivar](https://usb.ve), with a PhD in Political Science and a minor in Applied Statistics from [Texas Tech University](https://ttu.edu). Previously, I was an Instructor of Applied Statistical and Political Science Methods at the Department of Political Science at TTU, currently serving as Professor Ad Honorem at the Department of Social Sciences at USB. I am skilled in managing the full data lifecycle (collection, cleaning, modeling, and advanced analysis). Proven ability to mentor and guide individuals through complex data processes, ensuring high-quality outcomes. Adept at translating and communicating data insights into actionable recommendations through clear visualization, scientific reporting, and presentations to answer key research questions and hypotheses.

I have a strong foundation in both classic statistical methods and modern computational techniques. I use my skills to build predictive and prescriptive models from complex datasets. My work isn't just about the numbers; I'm passionate about digging into unstructured data with tools that ranges from AI and Machile Learning to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and mapping out connections with Social Network Analysis (SNA) to find meaningful insights. Iâ€™m also experienced in data mining, finding valuable patterns in large and varied data sources using Deep Learning and Neural Networks. My go-to tools are Python, R, and their rich ecosystem of libraries like scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas, Tidyverse, Tidymodels, and quanteda, and I've even worked in high-performance computing environments. It's all about tackling tough problems and helping make decisions that truly matter.

My research focuses on authoritarianism, legislatures, democratic backsliding, and innovations in political regimes. I try to understand why and how autocrats and leaders employ tools in their arsenal to expand their power. This includes ways to innovate and subvert democratic innovations to increase their chances of survival.
